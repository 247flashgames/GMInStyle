# StyleMe
Thank you for finding Style&#xfeff;Me! This code and [I](https://github.com/247flashgames) are in no way endorsed by Group&#xfeff;Me. This is an unofficial custom stylesheet for [Group&#xfeff;Me](https://GroupMe.com).
## using
### getting the code
To use this, you can download and manually install the [`style.css`](https://github.com/247flashgames/StyleMe/blob/master/style.css). Preferredly, you can use a CSS `@import` like this:
```css
@import url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/247flashgames/StyleMe/master/style.css");
```
